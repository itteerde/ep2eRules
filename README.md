## Mesh

- **[Question](https://github.com/itteerde/ep2eRules/issues/2):** Does everyone need an `Anonymizer` (pg. 315) subscription to use it, or can a crew buy one and route the crew's hacking/communications meant to be anonymous through that crew member's `Mesh Inserts` (at least if in `VPN` with them)? <br/>
  **Ruling:** Every user needs their own.


## Nanofabbing

- **Scavaging for Raw Materials:** Mining (`Disassambly Tools`), Scavaging (`Disassambly Tools`), and breaking items down with `Nanofabbers` all create `Raw Materials`. These come in three categories: `Min/1`, `Mod/2`, `Maj/3` (which also means they can be acquired as gear). A successful two hour task action can produce one `Min/1` `Raw Materials`; eight hours can produce one `Mod/2` `Raw Materials`;  24 hours can produce one `Maj/3` `Raw Materials`. If breaking down an item with a `Nanofabber`, when breaking down the item, a `Complexity` value can be broken up in matching pools. For example, breaking one `Maj/3` item would allow you to choose to produce either 3 `Raw Materials` (`Min/1`), 1 `Raw Materials` (`Min/1`) and 1 `Raw Materials` (`Mod/2`), or 1 `Raw Materials` (`Maj/3`).
- **Ruling:** Regarding fabber <a name="nanofabbing_watermark">*watermarks*</a>: Nanofabricated items are physically watermarked on an atomic scale. To read a watermark, you must have access to a fabrication unit large enough disassemble the material being read. You must then feed some quantity of the fabricated material to the fabber unit and succeed on a `Program (Nanofabrication)` Test (`Task Action`) with a timeframe of 24 hours. This action must be taken on the proceeds of an item after it has been broken down with a fabrication unit. The amount of real time it takes to disassemble the material and read a watermark is dependent on the complexity of the item, regardless of how much of the item is fed to the fabrication unit.
  - `Cleaner Swarm` (pg. 345) destroys the signature/deletes the watermark, making it impossible to check the watermark.


## Resleeving

### Infomorphs
- **[Question](https://github.com/itteerde/ep2eRules/issues/1):** As an `Infomorph`, if not changing the kind of `Infomorph`, after Egocasting, do you have to do any of the `Resleeving Tests`: `Integration Test` (288) or `Resleeving Stress Test` (289)? <br/>
  **Ruling:** The book clearly says no. That means no.
- **[Question](https://github.com/itteerde/ep2eRules/issues/3):** Does `Rebooting` (pg. **261**, 264) cause any `Resleeving Tests` (pg. 288) for `Infomorphs`?<br/>
  **Ruling:** Rebooting does not require any form of resleeving test.
- **[Question](https://github.com/itteerde/ep2eRules/issues/4):** When `Resleeving` (pg. 288) from `Backup` (pg. 286), which if any `Resleeving Tests` (pg. 288) do `Infomorphs` (pg. 252) do?<br/>
  **Ruling:** You must perform a resleeving test, both parts.
