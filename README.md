## Mesh

- **[Question](https://github.com/itteerde/ep2eRules/issues/2):** Does everyone need an `Anonymizer` (pg. 315) subscription to use it, or can a crew buy one and route the crew's hacking/communications meant to be anonymous through that crew member's `Mesh Inserts` (at least if in `VPN` with them)? <br/>
  **Ruling:** Every user needs their own.


## Nanofabbing

- **Ruling:** Regarding fabber *watermarks*: nanofabricated items are physically watermarked on an atomic scale. To read a watermark, you must have access to a fabrication unit large enough disassemble the material being read. You must then feed some quantity of the fabricated material to the fabber unit and succeed on a `Program (Nanofabrication)` Test (`Task Action`) with a timeframe of 24 hours. This action must be taken on the proceeds of an item after it has been broken down with a fabrication unit. The amount of real time it takes to disassemble the material and read a watermark is dependent on the complexity of the item, regardless of how much of the item is fed to the fabrication unit.
  - `Cleaner Swarm` (pg. 345) destroys the signature/ delete the watermark, making this checking of the watermark impossible.


## Resleeving

### Infomorphs
- **[Question](https://github.com/itteerde/ep2eRules/issues/1):** As an `Infomorph`, if not changing the kind of `Infomorph`, after Egocasting, do you have to do any of the `Resleeving Tests`: `Integration Test` (288) or `Resleeving Stress Test` (289)? <br/>
  **Ruling:** The book clearly says no. That means no.
- **[Question](https://github.com/itteerde/ep2eRules/issues/3):** Does `Rebooting` (pg. **261**, 264) cause any `Resleeving Tests` (pg. 288) for `Infomorphs`?<br/>
  **Ruling:** Rebooting does not require any form of resleeving test.
- **[Question](https://github.com/itteerde/ep2eRules/issues/4):** When `Resleeving` (pg. 288) from `Backup` (pg. 286), which if any `Resleeving Tests` (pg. 288) do `Infomorphs` (pg. 252) do?<br/>
  **Ruling:** You must perform a resleeving test, both parts.
